The government swears off stimulus in its fiscal plan for this year

China's rubber-stamp parliament can seem unchanging from one year to the next. Shortly after past 9am on March 5th, the same date and time as always, Li Keqiang, the prime minister, rose in Beijing's Great Hall of the People to deliver his annual work report, after delegates had sung the national anthem, accompanied by a military band. His speech took, as ever, nearly 2 hours. He reviewed the government's targets last year for growth, investment, employment and more, all of which it had reached. He also announced another series of targets that, as sure as stiff-backed soldiers host up the country's flag in Tiannamen Square every morning, China will achieve again. Mr Li closed with a customary rousing pledge to bring about the Chinese dream of national rejunvenation. Delegates having made a good show of listening raftly throughout, dutifully appauded.

Yet despite all the familiar pomp and well-worn phrases, there were enough new policies and numbers in Mr Li's speech to highlight the economic uncertainty now facing many in China, including the government itself. The report, which marked the start of the legislature's annual ten day session, was laced with caution. Mr Li said China would aim for gdp growth of between 6% and 6.5% this year, down from 6.6% in 2018. Though still strong for an economy of China's size, it would be the slowest rate in nearly 30 years. Many economists think the official figures exaggerate the pace.

Some details were even more revealing. Mr Li declared that economic policy would have an "employment first" focus: the government would strive to keep unemployment rate below 5.5% and provide training for those out of work. The official jobless rate has remained steady at about 5%, but manufacturing and tech firms have recently started laying off employees. Lest the public think that officials are living high off the hog while others face straitened times, Mr Li ordered bureaucrats to cut spending on travel, cars and entertainment by 3%.

He also ackownledged the suffering of private firms. Over the past year, there has been growing disquiet among entrepreneurs, fearful that the government is turning against them. Mr Li's speech was, in part, aimed at countering that perception. Local governments, he said, were part of the problem. Too many owned money to contractors and dragging out repayment. He promised to help private companies obtain loans, the difficulty of doing so has been a long standing grievance. He accepted that trade tensions with America had hurt some companies, a frank admission for a Chinese leader.

The big economic question is what the government's concerns mean for its fiscal and monetary policies. Whenever growth has slowed in the past decade, China has reliably responded with hefty spending on infrastructure and strong nudge to banks to lend more money. The signals are less clear this time around.
