The government swears off stimulus in its fiscal plan for this year

China's rubber-stamp parliament can seem unchanging from one year to the next. Shortly past 9am on March 5th, the same date and time as always, Li Keqing, the prime minister, rose in Beijing's Great Hall of the people to deliver his annual work report, after delegates had sung the national anthem, accompanied by a military band. His speech took, as ever, nearly 2 hours. He reviewed the government's targets last year for growth, investments, employment and more, all of which it had reached. He also announced another series of targets that, as sure as stiff-backed soldiers hoist up the country's flag in Tiananmen Square every morning, China will achieve again. Mr Li closed with a customary rousing pledge to bring about the Chinese dream of national rejunvenation. Delegates, having made a good show of listening raptly throughout, dutifully applauded.

Yet despite all the familiar pomp and well-worn phrases, there were enough new policies and numbers in Mr Li's speech to highlight the economic uncertainty now facing many in China, including the government itself. The report, which marked the start of the legislature's annual ten-day session, was laced with caution. Mr Li said China would aim for gdp growth of between 6% to 6.5% this year, down from 6.6% in 2018. Though still strong for an economy of China's size, it would be the slowest rate in nearly 30 years. Many economists think the official figures exaggerate the pace.
