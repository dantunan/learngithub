Beyond the Great Wall and the chain of rugged hills through which it snakes,workers are putting the finishing touches to a colossal ediface. The beam of its roof are curved, with golden tiles reminiscent of those that adorn the Forbidden City, 70 kilometers to the south-east. The building it self curves too, in a shape that its architects say resembles a Ruyi, a traditional Chinese talisman. They say it invokes a longing for fulfilment of the Chinese dream, that is a cherished slogan of China's leader Xi Jinping, whose wish is that China should emerge as a global giant. As the state news agency puts it, the building conveys the "imposing manner of a great power".  

The China Pavilion, as the structure is called, it's for an international flower festival in Yanqing, a satellite town of the capital. The show will open on April 23th, and last for more than five months. It will be the biggest expo of any kind that China has staged under the eagis of Paris based beauro International des exposition since the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. It will be the biggest horticultral one ever held anywhere, and it will be the centerpiece of the largest political celebration in China in a decade, the 70th anniversry of founding the communist state. The big day it self will be on October 1st, as the festerval enters its final week.

The choreography of the coming year will convey Mr. Xi's dream to perfection. In April, on a date to be annunced, forein leaders from the world will gather in Beijing discussing President Xi's Belt and Road initiative, a scheme involving billions dollors of Chinese loan to and investment to infrastructure projects around the world. Political influence wield by countries with economic largesse is often called hard power, more power of an even harder kind is likely to be shown off when, if tradition is up held, the country's armed might will be paraded through the central Beijing, tanks, jets, nuclear missiles and thousands of troops shouting "Hello Chair" to their commander in chief Mr. Xi.

The flower festival will be the soft power filling between these events and involve many times more people, 16 million visitors are expected, says organisers. Officials are keen to make sure a record number of contries and international organizations would put on the display, they have succedd, at least 110 have signed up. 

Many people in the Capital are unaware of what will soon unfold. The site in Yanqing is on the outer peripheral of Beijing Municipality, far beyond its urban core. The Great Wall at Badaling is Yanqing's beggest attraction. For now, tourists have little reason to head beyond it to the district's main town, near to which, on the requistioned farm land, the show will be held.
