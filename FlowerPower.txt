Beyond the Great Wall and the chain of rugged hills through which it snakes, workers are pushing the finishing touches to a colossal edifice. The beams of the root are curved, with golden tiles that reminiscent of those that adorn the Forbidden city. The building itself curves, too, in a shape its architects say resembles a ruyi, a traditional Chinese talisman. They say it invokes the longing for fulfillment of the Chinese dream. That is a cherished slogan of China's leader Xi Jinping, whose wish was China should emerge as global giant. As the state media puts it, the building conveys "an imposing manner of a great power".
The China Pavilion, as the building is called, is for an international flower festival in Yanqing, a satellite town of the capital. It will open on April 29th, and last for more than 5 months. it will be the biggest expo of any kind that China has staged under the aegis of Paris-based Bureau Internation des Exposition since the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, it will be the biggest horticultural one ever held anywhere, and it will be the centrepie of the largest political celebration in China in a decade, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state. The big day itself will be on October 1st, as the show enters its final week.
The choreography of the coming year will convey Mr Xi's dream to perfection. In April, on a date to be anounced, foreign leaders will gather Beijing discussing the president's Belt and Road Initiative, a scheme involving billions of dollars of Chinese loans to and investment in infrastructure projects around the world. A senior Chinese diplomat has said this will be the most important diplomatic event in China this year. The clout that countries wield with economic largesse is often described as the hard power, more power of an even harder kind is likely to be shown off on October 1st when, if tradition is upheld, the country's armed might will be paraded through central Beijing, tank, jets, nuclear missiles and thousands of troops shouting "Hello Chairman" to their commander in chief, Mr Xi. 
The flower festival will be the Soft power filling between those events and involve many times more people, 16 million visitors are expected, organisers say. Officials are keen to ensure a record number of countries and international organizations would put on display at the expo, they have succeeded, at least 110 have signed up. Many people in the capital are unware of the scale of what will soon unfold. The site in Yanqing is on the outer periphery of Beijing municipality, far beyond its urban core. The Great Wall at Badaling is Yanqing's biggest attraction. For now, visitors have little reason to head beyond that to the district's main town, near to where, on the requisitioned farmland, the show will be held. It will be the biggest international festival in Beijing since it has staged the Olympic Games in 2008.
On the riverside spot thousands of workers have build a park, half as big as the one made for the Olympic Game, which was previously the city's record setter.
