Beyond the Great Wall and the chain of rugged hills through which it snakes, workers are pushing the finishing touches to a colossal edifice. The beams of the root are curved, with golden tiles that reminiscent of those that adorn the Forbidden city. The building itself curves, too, in a shape its architects say resembles a ruyi, a traditional Chinese talisman. They say it invokes the longing for fulfillment of the Chinese dream. That is a cherished slogan of China's leader Xi Jinping, whose wish was China should emerge as global giant. As the state media puts it, the building conveys "an imposing manner of a great power".
The China Pavilion, as the building is called, is for an international flower festival in Yanqing, a satellite town of the capital. It will open on April 29th, and last for more than 5 months. it will be the biggest expo of any kind that China has staged under the aegis of Paris-based Bureau Internation des Exposition since the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, it will be the biggest horticultural one ever held anywhere, and it will be the centrepie of the largest political celebration in China in a decade, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state. The big day itself will be on October 1st, as the show enters its final week.
The choreography of the coming year will convey Mr Xi's dream to perfection. In April, on a date to be anounced, foreign leaders will gather Beijing discussing the president's Belt and Road Initiative, a scheme involving billions of dollars of Chinese loans to and investment in infrastructure projects around the world. A senior Chinese diplomat has said this will be the most important diplomatic event in China this year. The clout that countries wield with economic largesse is often described as the hard power, more power of an even harder kind is likely to be shown off on October 1st when, if tradition is upheld, the country's armed might will be paraded through central Beijing, tank, jets, nuclear missiles and thousands of troops shouting "Hello Chairman" to their commander in chief, Mr Xi. 
The flower festival will be the Soft power filling between those events and involve many times more people, 16 million visitors are expected, organisers say. Officials are keen to ensure a record number of countries and international organizations would put on display at the expo, they have succeeded, at least 110 have signed up. Many people in the capital are unware of the scale of what will soon unfold. The site in Yanqing is on the outer periphery of Beijing municipality, far beyond its urban core. The Great Wall at Badaling is Yanqing's biggest attraction. For now, visitors have little reason to head beyond that to the district's main town, near to where, on the requisitioned farmland, the show will be held. It will be the biggest international festival in Beijing since it has staged the Olympic Games in 2008.
On the riverside spot thousands of workers have build a park, half as big as the one made for the Olympic Game, which was previously the city's record setter. The festival will fill the new park, with a enclosed area covering more than half of it.
The event will be of huge political importance, this can be reflected in its heavy weight line-up organizing committee. It includes some of the country's most powerful officials. Two of them are members of the ruling Politburo, Hu Chunhua, who is the deputy prime minister, and Caiqi, who is the party chief of Beijing. Mr Cai calls this event a glorious political task handed to the city by central leadership. Also on the team are 18 deputy heads of ministries, including those in charge of China's police and spies, and Jiang Zehui, a first cousin and adoptive sister the Jiang Zemin, the former president.
Organisers have been told to let their work be guided by Xi Jinping's thought, they have clearly followed order. The event will be suffused with symbolic references to Mr Xi's favorate topics, from pursuing the Chinese dream to creating a beautiful China. The official theme of the show:"Live green, live better", echoes his call for a better environment. The fact that the show will be held in a city so acutely short of water appears not to worry officials. A diversion scheme that brings water from distant Yangzi river basin began supplementing the city's supply in 2014, this has freed up a reservior near the expo site to ensure the plants stay moist. 
To ease the flow of visitors, the city is on an spree of infrastructure spending. There are already two motorways, G6 and G7, that lead to Yanqing, visitors to the Great Wall often use them. But they are frequently congested. On January 1st, a new express way, more than 40km long, was opened. It connects Yanqing with the northern suburb of Beijing. Planning documents for the new road, called Xingyan, make it clear that the expo has been at least one of the main reasons for building it to this schedule. It has cost more than 13 billion Yuan and involved boring a 5.9km tunnel beneath the Great Wall, about half the length of the one beneath Blac Mont, and the longest in Beijing's road network. It has also been controversial, some environmentalists say this route threatens a ecologically sensitive area.
