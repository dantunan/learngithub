Beyond the Great Wall and the chain of rugged hills through which it snakes, workers are putting the finishing touches to a colossal edifice. The beams of its roof are curved, with golden tiles reminiscent of those that adorn the Forbidden City, 70km to the south-east. The building itself curves, too, in a shape that its architects say resembles a Ruyi, a traditional Chinese talisman. They say it invokes a longing for fulfilment of the Chinese dream, that is a cherished slogan of China's leader Xi Jinping, whose wish is that China should emerge as a global giant. As the state news agency puts it, the building conveys the "imposing manner of a great power".  

The China Pavilion, as the structure is called, is for an international flower festival in Yanqing, a satellite town of the capital. The show will open on April 29th and last for more than five months. It will be the biggest expo of any kind that China has staged under the aegis of the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions since the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. It will be the biggest horticultural one ever held anywhere. And it will be the centrepiece of the largest political celebration in China in a decade: the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state. The big day itself will be on October 1st, as the flower show enters its final week.

The choreography of the coming year will convey Mr. Xi's dream to perfection. In April, on a date to be annunced, forein leaders from the world will gather in Beijing discussing President Xi's Belt and Road initiative, a scheme involving billions dollors of Chinese loan to and investment in infrastructure projects around the world. A senior Chinese diplomat has said "it will be the most important diplomatic event" in China this year. The clout that countries wield with economic largesse is sometimes described as hard power, more power of an even harder kind is likely to be shown off when, if tradition is up held, the country's armed might will be paraded through the central Beijing, tanks, jets, nuclear missiles and thousands of troops shouting "Hello Chair" to their commander in chief Mr. Xi.

The flower festival will be the soft power filling between these events and involve many times more people, 16 million visitors are expected, says organisers. Officials are keen to make sure a record number of contries and international organizations would put on the display, they have succedd, at least 110 have signed up. 

Many people in the Capital are unaware of what will soon unfold. The site in Yanqing is on the outer periphery of Beijing Municipality, far beyond its urban core. The Great Wall at Badaling is Yanqing's beggest attraction. For now, tourists have little reason to head beyond it to the district's main town, near to which, on the requistioned farm land, the show will be held. It will be the biggest international festival in Beijing since it staged the Olympic games in 2008.

Extravaganza floribunda
On the riverside spot thousands of workers have built a 960 hectare park, about half as big as the one made for the Olympics, which was the city's previous record setter. The Expo will fill the new park, with a closed area covering more than half of it.

It will be of huge political importance. This is reflected in its heavyweight line-up organizing committee. It includes some of the country's most powerful officials, two of them are members of the ruling politburo. Hu Chunhua, who is the deputy prime minister, and Cai Qi, the party chief of Beijing. Mr Cai calls the festival a glorious political task handed to the city by central leadership. Also on the team are 18 deputy heads of ministries (including those in charge of China's police and spy) and Jiang Zehui, the first cousin and adoptive sister of Jiang Zemin, China's former president.

Organisers have been told to let their work guided by Xi Jinping thought, they have clearly followed orders. The event will be suffused with symblic references to Mr. Xi's favorate topics, from persuing Chinese Dream to creating a beautiful China. The expo's official theme, "Live green, live better" echos his calls for a better environment. The fact that the festival is taking place in a city so acutely short of water appears not to worry officials. A diversion scheme that brings water from distant Yangzi river basin began supplementing the city's supply in 2014. This has freed up a reservoir near the expo site to ensure the plants stay moist.

To ease the flow of visitors, the city has been on an infrastructure spending spree. There are already two motorways, the G6 and G7, that lead to Yanqing (visitors to the Great Wall often use them). But they are frequently congested. On January 1st a new expressway, more than 40km long, was opend. It connects the northern suburbs of the capital with Yanqing. The planning documents for the new road, called Xing-yan, make it clear that the expo has been one of the main reasons for building it to its schedule. It has costed 13 billion yuan and involved boring a 5.9km tunnel beneath the Great Wall, about half the length of the one beneath Mount Blac and the longest in Beijing's road newwork. It has also been controversial, some environmentalists say the route threatens an ecologically sensitive area.

Officials say the new road will also be of help for the Winter Olympics in 2022, part of which will be held in Yanqing, another part in the neighbouring province of Hebei. But extending the motor way to Hebei has created a problem, the route cuts along one edge of the new park. To avoid spoiling the view, planners decided to build a 2km tunnel beneath the park and under the Guishui river, which flows through it. For all the green-themed rhetoric of the exop, fossil-fuelled cars will play a big role. Ten car parks with a total of 22,000 spaces have been built for those who prefer to drive there.
