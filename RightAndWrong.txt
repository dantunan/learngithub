A year before Xi Jinping became China's leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University, Zhang Qianfan, delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre stood shoulder to shoulder around the walls. They grinned and clapped when he started by saying:"I have written down my true feelings, they may sound fierce. Forgive me if they cause offence."

The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who unable to find space in the room, had crowded by the doorway, were still there when he finished, almost 2 hours later. That was fortunate, because his final point was the most powerful in a lecture packed with indictments of China's failure to implement the guarantees of its constitution, including freedom of speech, of assembly and of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where authoritarian rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from Soviet Union to Taiwan to countries that had experienced the Arab Spring recently. "What there people can do, then Chinese people" and here he paused briefly and audience begun to clap and laugh, "can certainly do", wild applause ensue, someone cried, "good".

Such a scene was extraordinary even at the time. The authorities were determined to prevent any attempts to replicate the Arab Uprisings; anonymous calls online for public gatherings in support of them drew more police than protesters. Mr Zhang says he was reprimanded for his speech, and invitations for him to talk on campuses dried up. But he kept his job, and remarkably his textbook "An introduction to the study of constitutional law", first published in 2004, was republished in 2014 by Law Press, which is controled by the Ministry of Justice. The preface set the tone: "The study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the right of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zone".

Mr Xi initially appeared to agree, at least rhetorically. In 2012, shortly after he took the power, he gave a striking speech on the supremacy of the constitution and how no organization or individual could stand above it. Ceremonies to swear allegiance to the constitution, such as the one pictured, proliferated.  But it soon became clear that his main interest was in Article 1, which say: Disruption of socialist system by any organisation or individual is prohibited." In 2013, after some small protests broke out in the southern city of Guangzhou over sensors' effort to prevent a newspaper from publishing an editorial in praise of constitutionalism, state media launched a propaganda offensive against this term, they say this is just another way of calling for Western style democracy. To the dismay of liberals, Mr Xi secured a constitutional revision last year that allows him to remain president for life.

Under his rule, the Communist party has been waging its toughest campaign against dissent and liberal values since the afteramth of the Tiananmen Square Protests nearly 30 years ago. In 2015 police rounded up hundreds of lawyers and legal activists who had been trying to help citizens use the courts to reverse injustices perpetrated by officials, the kind of cases that, as Mr Zhang says in his textbook, touch on constitutional matters, not just ordinary legal ones. Many of the detainees have been released, but banned from doing legal work and kept under surveillance. Some have been tried and imprisoned. The final related trial endded on January 28th with the sentencing of Wang Quanzhang, a human-rights lawyer, to 4-and-half years in prison for subversion.

Now the party is focusing more closely on campuses, where many scholars still support constitutionalism. The party is right, the word for this, "xianzheng" is just an veiled way of refering to Western democracy, or at any rate just the nice bits of the constitution. In January the ministry of Education ordered every university to report to the authorities which textbook they were using for constitutional studies. The said reasons for this thorough investigation include the need to implement Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristic for the new era, and revise and impove textbooks in a timely manner.

Mr Zhang's popular textbook is likely to be a victim of the purge that is all but sure to follow. There is evidence that the book is in the party's sights already. In the past few days, online bookshops have already stopped selling it, those trying to buy it see messages such as "the product has been removed from the shelves" or in the case of Amazon's website in China "stock is currently not available". (Censors how ever, have yet to eradicate a pirated digital version of this book, a link to which was circulated in late January on Weibo, a microblog site, by an academic in central China.

The authorites have long tried to impose orthodoxy on campuses. In 2015 they orded tighter control on the use of imported books that spread Western values. The minister of Education urged universities to ensue that comments in classroom do not attack or defame the rule of the party or smear socialism, Nor, he said, should they violate the constitution or laws, meaning, presumably, the bits of the constitution that affirm the party's primacy. Closed-circuit televison cameras have been installed in many lecture theatres to allow classes to be monitored. About 15 years ago the government launched what it called the Marxism Theory Research and Construction Project to provide sanitised textbooks. Some universities have begun to demand that only those be used for legal studies.

In spite of this, and the occasional sacking of academics for their political views, elite institutes are still full of liberals. Mr Zhang reckons there are probably thousands of people who teach constitutional law in China. he suspects most of them share his views. Cracking down is hard, many of the academics at leading universities are people who have studied in the west. Mr Zhang has a phd in biophysics from Carnege Mellon University and another in the theory of government from the University of Texas at Austin, purging these professors would be a huge set back for China's effort to attract talent from abroad and create world class universities.

But a sensitive year lies ahead. Officials are mindful of two looming anniversaries: the 100th of a student movement that called for china to introduce western science and democracy on May 4th; and the 30th of the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen square protests, which were also led by students, on June 4th. Mr Zhang's institution, Peking University, played a central role in both upheavals. In the coming months the authorities will be more than usually worried about scholors who inspire their students with liberal view.

Some students clearly support Mr Zhang. On Peking University's chat forum, several messages have appeared criticising the removal of his textbook from online bookshops (but also some attacking him). Mr Zhang says that if he was able to give another lecture like the one he gave in 2013, students would be even more supportive that they were then." We are moving even further away from constitutionalism. Everybody can feel the restriction of speech, he says, more people are discontented about our political reality today.
