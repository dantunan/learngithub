A year before Xi Jinping became China's leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre stood shoulder-to-shoulder around the walls, they grinned and clapped when he started by saying: "I have written down my true feeling, they my sound fierce, forgive me if they cause offense."
The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who unable to find space in the room had crowed by the doorway, were still there when he finished, after almost two hours later. That was fortunate, because his final point was the most powerful in a lecture full of indictment of China's failure in implementing the guarantees of the constitution, including the freedom of speech, of assembly, of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where authoritarian rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from the Soviet Union to taiwan to countries that had recently experienced the Arab spring, he said, "what there people can do" here he paused briefly while the audience began to laugh and clap, "Chinese people can certainly do", wild applause ensued, people cried, "good".
Such a scene was extraodinary even at the time. The authorities were determined to prevent any attempts to replicate the Arab uprisings; anonymous calls on line for a public gathering in support of them drew more police than protesters. Mr Zhang says he was reprimanded for his speech, invitations for him to talk on campuses dried up, but he kept his job. And remarkably his textbook, "An Introduction to the Study of Constitutional Law", first published in 2004, was republished in 2014 by Law Press, which is controled by the ministry of Justice. The preface sets the tone: "the study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the rights of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zones."
Mr Xi initially appeared to agree, at least rhetorically. In 2012, shortly after he took power, he gave a striking speech on the supremacy of constitution and how no organisation or individual could stand above it. Ceremonies to swear allegiance to the constitution, such as the one pictured, proliferated. But it soon became clear that his main interest was in Article one, which says: Disruption of the socialist system by any organisation of individual is prohibited. In 2013, after small protest broke out in the southern city of Guangzhou over censors' efforts to prevent a newspaper from publishing an editorial in praise of "constitutionalism", state media launched a propaganda offensive against the term, they said it was just another way of calling for the Western-style democracy. To the dismay of liberals, Mr Xi secured a constitution revision last year that allows him to remian president for life.
Under his rule, the Communist party has been waging its toughest campaign against dissent and liberal values since the aftermath of the Tiananmen square protests nearly 30 years ago. In 2015 police rounded up hundreds of lawyers and legal activists who had been trying to help citizens use the court to reverse injustices perpetrated by officials, the kind of cases that, as Mr Zhang says in his textbook, touch on constitutional matters, not just ordinary legal ones. Many of the detainees have been released but banned from doing legal work and kept under surveillance. Some have been tried and imprisoned. The final related trial endded on January 28th with the sentencing of Wang Jianzhang, a human-rights lawyer, to four-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.
