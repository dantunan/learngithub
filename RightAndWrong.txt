A year before Xi Jinping became China's leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre stood shoulder-to-shoulder around the walls, they grinned and clapped when he started by saying: "I have written down my true feeling, they my sound fierce, forgive me if they cause offense."
The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who unable to find space in the room had crowed by the doorway, were still there when he finished, after almost two hours later. That was fortunate, because his final point was the most powerful in a lecture full of indictment of China's failure in implementing the guarantees of the constitution, including the freedom of speech, of assembly, of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where authoritarian rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from the Soviet Union to taiwan to countries that had recently experienced the Arab spring, he said, "what there people can do" here he paused briefly while the audience began to laugh and clap, "Chinese people can certainly do", wild applause ensued, people cried, "good".
Such a scene was extraordinary even at the time. The authorities were determined to prevent any attempt to replicate the Arab uprising; anonymous calls online for public gathering in support of them drew more police than protesters. Mr Zhang says he was reprimanded for his speech. Invitations for him to talk on campuses dried up. But he kept his job. And remarkably his textbook, "An introduction to the study of constitutional law" first published in 2004, was republished in 2014 by Law Press, which is controlled by the ministry of Justice. The preface sets the tone: "The study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the rights of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zones."
