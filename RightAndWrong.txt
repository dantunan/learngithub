A year before Mr Xi became China's leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University, Zhang Quanzhong, delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre, stood shoulder-to-shoulder around walls. they grinned and clapped when he started by saying:"I have written down my true feelings, they may sound fierce, forgive me if they cause offense."

The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who unable to find space in the room, had crowed by the doorway, were still there when he finished, almost 2 hours later. That was fortunate, because the final point was the most powerful in a lecture packed with indictments of China's failure to implement the guarantees of its constitution, including freedom of speech, of assembly and of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where authoritarian rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from soviet union to Taiwan to countries that had been experienced that arab spring recently. "What their people can do, Chinese people" here he paused briefly while the audience begun to laugh and clap "can certainly do as well", wild applause ensued, someone cried "good".

Such a scene was extraodinary even at the time. The authorities were determined to prevent any attempt to replicate the Arab uprisings; anonymous calls on line for public gathering in support of them drew more police than protesters. Mr Zhang says he was reprimanded for his speech. Invitations for him to talk on campuses dried up, but he kept his job. And remarkably his textbook "An introduction to the study of constitutional law", first published in 2004, was republished by Law Press, which is controled by Ministry of Justice. The preface sets the tone: "The study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the rights of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zones."

Mr Xi initially appeared to agree, at least rhetorically. In 2012, shortly after he took power, he gave a striking speech on the supremacy of the constitution and how no organization or individual could stand above it. Ceremonies to swear allegiance to the constitution, such as the one pictured, proliferated. But soon it became clear that his main interest was in Article 1, which says: disruption of socialist system by any organisation or individual is prohibited. In 2013, after small protests broke out in the southern city of Guangzhou over sensors' efforts to prevent a newspaper from publishing a editorial in praise of "constitutionalism", state media launched a propaganda offensive agains this term, they say this is just another way of calling for Western-style democracy. To the dismay of liberals, Mr Xi secured a constitutional revision last year that allows him to remain president for life.

Under his rule, the Communist party has been waging its roughest campaign against dissidents and liberal values since the aftermath of the Tiananmen square protest nearly 30 years ago. In 2015, police rounded up hundread of lawyers and legal activists who had been trying to help citizens use the court to reverse injustice perpetrated by officals, the kind of cases that, as Mr Zhang says in his textbook, touch on the constitutional principles, not just ordinary legal ones. Many of the detainees have been released but banned from doing legal work, and kept under surveillance. Some have been tried and imprisoned. The final related trial ended on January 28th with the sentencing of Wang Qangzhang, a human-rights lawyer, to 4-and-half years in prison for subversion.

Now the party in focusing more closely on campuses, where many legal scholars still support constitutionalism. The party is ritht, the word for this, xianzheng, is often just a veiled way of referring to Western-style democracy, and at any rate just the nice bits of the constitution. In January the Ministry of Education ordered every university to report to the authorities which textbook they were using for constitutional studies. It said reasons for this thorough investigation include the need to implement Xi JInping's thought on socialism with Chinese charicteristic for a new era, and to revise and improve the textbook in a timerly manner.

Mr Zhang's popular textbook is likely to be a victim of this purge that is all but sure to follow. There is evidence that this book is in the party's sights already. In the past few days online bookshops have stopped selling it. Those trying to buy it see messages such as "this product has been removed from the shelves" or in the case of Amazon's website in China, stock is currently not available. censors, however, have yet to eradicate the pirated digital version of this book, a link to which was circulated in late January on Weibo, a microblog site, by a academic in central China.

The authorities have long tried to impose orthodoxy on campuses. In 2015 they ordered tighter controls on the use of imported books that spread "Western values". The minister of Education urged universities to ensue that comments in classroom do not "attack or defame the rule of the party or smear socialism". Nor, he said, should they "violate the constitution and laws" meaning, presumably, the bits of the constitution that affirm the party's primacy. Closed-circuit television cameras have been installed in many lecture theatres to allow classes to be monitored. About 15 years ago the government launched what it called the "Marxism Theory research and construction projects" to produce sanitised textbooks. Some universities have begun to demand that only these be used for legal studies.

In spite of this, and the occasional sackings of academics for their political views, elite institutions are still full of liverals. Mr Zhang reckons there are probably thousands of people who teach constitutional law in China. He suspects most of them share his views. Cracking down is hard: many academics at leading universities are people who have studied in the West. Mr Zhang has a phd in biophysics from Carnegie Mellon University and another one in the theory of government from the University of Texas at Austin. Purging these professors would be a huge setback for China's efforts to attract talent from abroad and create world class universities.

But a sensitive year lies ahead. Officials are mindful of two looming anniversaries: the 100th of a student movement that called for China to introduce (Western) science and democracy, on May 4th. and the 30th of the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, which were also led by students, on June 4th. Mr Zhang's institution, Peking University, played a central role in both upheavals. In the coming months the authorities will be more than usually worried about scholars who inspires students with liberal views.
