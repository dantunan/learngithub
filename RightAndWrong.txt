A year before Mr Xi became China's leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University, Zhang Qianfan, delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre stood shoulder-to-shoulder around the walls. They grinned and clapped when he started by saying:" I have written down my true feelings, they may sound fierce, forgive me if they cause offence."

The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who, unable to find space in the room, has crowed by the doorway, were still there when he finished, almost two hours later. That was fortunate, because his final point was the most powerful in a lecture packed with indictments of China's failure to implement the guarantees of its constitution, including the freedom of speech, of assembly and of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where  rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from Soviet Union to Taiwan to countries that had experienced the Arab spring recently. "What their people can do" he said, "the Chinese" here he paused briefly while the audience began to laugh and clap, "people can certainly do." Wild applause ensued, someone cried "good!"

Such a scene was extraordinary even at the time. The authorities were determined to prevent any attempt to replicate the Arab uprisings, anonymous calls on line for public gathering in support of them drew more police than protesters. Mr Zhang says he was reprimanded for his speech, invitations for him to talk on campuses dried up. But he kept his job, and remarkably, his textbook, "An introduction to the study of constitutional law" first published in 2004, was republished by Law press, which is controled the Ministry of Justice. The preface sets the tone: "The study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the rights of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zones."

Mr Xi initially appeared to agree, at least rhetorically. In 2012, short after he took power, he gave a striking speech on the supremacy of the constitution and how no organisation or individual could stand above it. Ceremonies to swear allegiance to the constitution, such as the one pictured, proliferated. But It soon became clear that his main interest was in Article 1, which says: "Disruption of the socialist system by any organisation or individual was prohibited." In 2013, after small protests broke out in the southern city of Guangzhou over sensors' effort to prevent a newspaper from publishing an editorial in praise of "constitutionalism", state media launched a propaganda offensive against this term, they said it was just another way of calling for Western-style democracy. To the dismay of liberals, Mr Xi secured a constitutional revison last year that allows him to remian resident for life

Under his rule, the Communist party has been waging its toughest campaign against dissent and liberal values since the aftermath of the tiananmen square protest nearly 30 years ago. In 2015 police rounded up hundreds of lawyers and legal activists who had been trying to help citizens use courts to reverse injustices perpetrated by officials, such kind of cases that, as Mr Zhang says in his textbook, touch on constitutional matters, not just ordinary legal ones. Many of the detainees were released but banned from doing legal work and kept under surveillance, some have been tried and imprisoned, the final related trial endded on January 28th with the sentencing of Wang Quanzhang, a human rights lawyer, to a four-and-a-half year in prison for subversion.

Now the party is focusing more closely on campuses, where many legal scholars still support constitutionalism. The party is right: the word of xianzheng, is often just a veiled way of referencing to Western-style democracy, or at any rate just the nice bits of the constitution. In January the Ministry of Education ordered every university to report to the authorities which textbook they were using for constitutional studies. It said reasons for this thorough investigation include a need to implement Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and revise and improve textbooks in a timely manner.

Mr Zhang's popular textbook is likely to be a victim of the purge that is all but sure to follow.There is evidence that the book is in the party's sights already. In the past few days online bookshops have stopped selling it. Those trying to buy it see messages such as "this product has been removed from the shelves" or in the case of Amazon's website in China, "stock is currently not available". Censors hower, have yet to eradicate a pirated digital version of the book, a link to which was circulated in late January on Weibo, a microblog site, by an academic in central China.
